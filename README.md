# mat-kit
The goal was to build a small library to work with matrices while staying around 100 lines of code.<br>
Implementing however the core matrix operations such as:
* addition/subtraction
* multiplication by scalar
* multiplication row by column 
* determinant 
* inverse matrix
where possible.
